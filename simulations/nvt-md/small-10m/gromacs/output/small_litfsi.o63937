NOTE 3 [file system.top, line 1353]:
  In moleculetype 'system' 9 atoms are not bound by a potential or
  constraint to any other atom in the same moleculetype. Although
  technically this might not cause issues in a simulation, this often means
  that the user forgot to add a bond/potential/constraint or put multiple
  molecules in the same moleculetype definition by mistake. Run with -v to
  get information for each atom.

NOTE 3 [file system.top, line 1353]:
  In moleculetype 'system' 9 atoms are not bound by a potential or
  constraint to any other atom in the same moleculetype. Although
  technically this might not cause issues in a simulation, this often means
  that the user forgot to add a bond/potential/constraint or put multiple
  molecules in the same moleculetype definition by mistake. Run with -v to
  get information for each atom.

NOTE 3 [file system.top, line 1353]:
  In moleculetype 'system' 9 atoms are not bound by a potential or
  constraint to any other atom in the same moleculetype. Although
  technically this might not cause issues in a simulation, this often means
  that the user forgot to add a bond/potential/constraint or put multiple
  molecules in the same moleculetype definition by mistake. Run with -v to
  get information for each atom.
